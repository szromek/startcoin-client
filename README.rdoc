= startcoin-client

Provides a Ruby library to the complete Startcoin JSON-RPC API. Implements all methods listed
at {https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list}[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Startcoin_client/API_Calls_list].
Also supports customizing the host and port number to connect to.

== Installation

To install gem just add this entry to your Gemfile

  gem 'startcoin-client'
  gem 'json', '~> 1.5.3' # For Ruby < 1.9


== Usage

As with most Ruby gems, you first need to require the library into your project:

  require 'startcoin_client'

After doing this, the simplest possible usage looks like this:

  StartcoinClient('username', 'password').balance
  # => 0.001

Or, if you prefer a somewhat more explicit representation, the following code performs the exact
same task:

  client = StartcoinClient::Client.new('username', 'password')
  client.balance
  # => 0.001

The RPC method names available to you are exactly the same as those listed on the Startcoin wiki
(again, that's {https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Startcoin_client/API_Calls_list}[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Startcoin_client/API_Calls_list]). Some aliases
have been added to make them more "ruby-ish," but none of the original names have been changed.

== Host, Port, SSL, Proxy

Here are several examples of how you can change the host and proxy information:

  StartcoinClient('username', 'password', :host => 'example.com', :port => 38332, :ssl => true, :proxy => 'http://someproxy.com')

  client = StartcoinClient::Client.new('username', 'password', :host => 'example.com')
  client.port = 38332
  client.proxy = 'http://someproxy.com'
  client.ssl = true
  client.ssl?
  # => true

You should see the StartcoinClient::Client class documentation if you'd like to see the other options and methods
that are made available.

== Test environment

It's highly recommended to not connect StartcoinClient to live network, but instead use local testnet. One possibility is to use docker image called **bitcoin-testnet-box** (https://github.com/freewil/bitcoin-testnet-box). For installation process please follow instructions on its wiki page.

After successful instalation you can connect to wallets with following commands

  StartcoinClient('admin1', '123', :host => '127.0.0.1', :port => 19001)
  StartcoinClient('admin2', '123', :host => '127.0.0.1', :port => 19011)

At this point you can use regular RPC methods provided in API
